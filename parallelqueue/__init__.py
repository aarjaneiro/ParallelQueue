"""
The "ParallelQueue" project is currently in its early stages of development.
This package aims to allow for easier implementation of novel parallel processing
approaches in Python DES packages (especially SimPy).

Note
----
The GitHub master build can be (and likely is) different from the PyPi build, being more up-to-date.
For the time being, use the current **GitHub master branch** if starting a new project, using PyPi if and only if you require that particular
version (e.g., for code stability as it is updated less-frequently).
