Contributing
------------

Those interested in contributing to this project should do the following:

1. Find an issue in [Issues](https://github.com/aarjaneiro/ParallelQueue/issues) to solve.
     * If an issue/feature you want to work on is *not* currently on this list, **submit a new issue before proceeding!**
2. Fork this repository and implement your changes.
3. Submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/aarjaneiro/ParallelQueue/pulls) to your forked repository, 
mentioning the issue ID corresponding to your work in the title.
4. A maintainer will review your PR and see if any changes need to be made before merging it with the main repository.

Useful to know:
1. You can see [which issues currently have PRs](https://github.com/aarjaneiro/ParallelQueue/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+linked%3Apr).
2. If you are not yet finished but are far enough along that others should be warned of that (so they do not needlessly begin to work on the issue themselves), 
you can submit your PR as a draft, converting it to a full PR when ready. Doing so puts your work on the list of 
[which issues currently have PRs](https://github.com/aarjaneiro/ParallelQueue/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+linked%3Apr).
3. If your PR is accepted, credit will be given to you by adding your name and a link to your changes in the README!
